Welcome to my homepage!

My name is Wesley (Wes) Howden. I am a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Arizona Department of Economics ([university page](https://eller.arizona.edu/people/wesley-howden)) and work with the [Arizona Institute for Resilient Environments and Societies](https://environment.arizona.edu/aires). I recently received my Ph.D. in economics at the University of California San Diego.

I study how individuals and societies adapt and mitigate against the impacts of climate and environmental change.
