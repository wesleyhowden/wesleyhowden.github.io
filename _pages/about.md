Welcome to my homepage!

My name is Wesley (Wes) Howden. I am a postdoctoral research associate at the [University of Arizona Department of Economics](https://eller.arizona.edu/departments-research/schools-departments/economics) and work with the [Arizona Institute for Resilience](https://environment.arizona.edu/aires). I recently received my Ph.D. in economics at the University of California San Diego.

I study how individuals and societies adapt and mitigate against the impacts of climate and environmental change.

I will join Wesleyan University as an Assistant Professor of Economics in fall 2023.
